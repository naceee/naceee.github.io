<h2>Moarchiving</h2>
I collaborated with Tea Tušar, Mila Nedič, and Nikolaus Hansen on extending the Python package
<a href="https://github.com/CMA-ES/moarchiving">Moarchiving</a>. The library provides an efficient archive of
non-dominated solutions in multi-objective optimization and supports the calculation of various performance indicators.
Our main contribution was extending the library from handling two objectives to also supporting three and four dimensions,
along with adding the option to normalize indicator values.

<h3>Distance to the non-dominated area</h3>
One part of the project I particularly enjoyed was developing a function to calculate the distance between a dominated point
and the non-dominated area. While the two-dimensional case is relatively straightforward, extending the method to three or more
dimensions turned out to be a much more challenging and interesting problem.
A detailed explanation of the problem and our solution will soon be available in my
